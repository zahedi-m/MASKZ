==== FILE DESCRIPTIONS ====

== avrContNum_042020-042021.csv ==
++ This data was collected via a monthly representative phone survey on 1500 or 1000 participants.
++ Respondent population is representative over age, gender, settlement type and education level.
++ Contact numbers consider individual weights computed with iterative proportional fitting.

date: middle date of observation period (YYYY-mm-dd)
obs_start: beginning of observation period (dd.mm.yyyy)
obs_end: end of observation period (dd.mm.yyyy)
cn_avr: average of number of contacts
cn_var: variance of number of contacts



== wBehavioralDynamics_mask_abroad_travel_inf.csv ==
++ This data was collected via a daily non-representative online survey.
++ Close to representative populations were constructed by computing individual weights with
++ iterative proportional fitting over over age, gender, settlement type and education level.
++ Numbers are weighted averages and variance over daily respondents.

date: date of observation (YYYY-mm-dd)
epoch: date of observation (in epoch time)
fraction_mask: fraction of respondents wearing mask
fraction_travel_abroad: fraction of respondents travelled abroad
fraction_travel_settlement: fraction of respondents travelled to other settlement than home
infectednum: official reported number of detected cases



== wContactDyn_allfam_BP_CentrHU_RuralHU.csv ==
++ This data was collected via a daily non-representative online survey.
++ Close to representative populations were constructed by computing individual weights with
++ iterative proportional fitting over over age, gender, settlement type and education level.
++ Numbers are weighted averages and variance over daily respondents.
